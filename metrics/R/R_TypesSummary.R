## summary of types per collection
## greater than 50 specimens per type - This means that recent types are not captured since most of 
#### them were introduced years before.
## collection_cde used on x-axis, type statuses listed on y, and specimen numbers are color coded
## when we roll over the dots, information about Collection, type status, and specific count comes up.
