      <p>It is the collections staff responsibility to research the ownership of the media.  According to the OGC, we cannot legally distribute media through MCZbase for which we don’t have permission to use, which must be in writing.</p>
      <p>Any material created within the MCZ generally fall under the copyright of the President and Fellows of Harvard College. If it is not MCZ material, find out who created it and what copyright they are declaring. U.S. Government publications are in the public domain, but staff must ensure that this domain applies.</p>
      <p>We often link to scanned Biodiversity Heritage Library (BHL) articles and books, which should be listed as “Rights defined by 3rd party host” since BHL has worked out copyright permissions with the publication owners.  The most common designations for rights on BHL are: Public Domain and CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.  See <a href="http://biodivlib.wikispaces.com/Licensing+and+Copyright">http://biodivlib.wikispaces.com/Licensing+and+Copyright</a> for more information.</p>
      <p>For documents distributed through archive.org, they are provided for scholarship and research purposes only, and we still must check the copyright status of each document before linking to it.  See their terms and policies: <a href="https://archive.org/about/terms.php">https://archive.org/about/terms.php</a>.</p>
      <p>If you have any doubts about the copyright holder or status, DO NOT upload the media! Contact MCZ Collections Operations and we will try to help navigate the process to obtain permission.</p>
